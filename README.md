Google Play Store App Rating Predictor 

This project is a Google Play Store App Rating Predictor, which uses machine learning techniques to predict the rating of a mobile app based on various features such as reviews, size, installs, and price. The goal of the project is to provide app developers and stakeholders with insights into how different factors contribute to the overall rating of an app.
The project utilizes the Linear Regression model from the scikit-learn library to build the prediction model. The dataset used for training and testing the model is the 'googleplaystore.csv' file, which contains information about various apps available on the Google Play Store.

Features:
=>Data preprocessing: The code includes data preprocessing steps to handle missing values, convert data types, and remove unnecessary characters from the dataset.
=>Model training: The Linear Regression model is trained using the processed data to establish a relationship between the input features and the app rating.
=>Model evaluation: The performance of the model is evaluated using mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared score metrics to measure the accuracy of the predictions.
=>Prediction: The trained model can be used to predict the rating for a new app by providing the corresponding input features.
